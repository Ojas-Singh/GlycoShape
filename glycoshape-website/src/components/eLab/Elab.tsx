She obtained her Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry at the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 2004 under the supervision of Prof Dennis R. Salahub. After her Ph.D. she worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children (Sickkids) Research Institute in Toronto, where she specialised in biophysics and statistical mechanics-based methods in Dr Regis Pomes‚Äô research group. In 2008 Elisa joined Prof Rob Woods‚Äô Computational Glycobiology Laboratory as a Senior Research Scientist in the School of Chemistry at the University of Galway. She started her independent career in 2013 in the Department of Chemistry at Maynooth University, where she is now an Associate Professor. From January 2024 Elisa will be taking a new position in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Southampton, where she will be an Associate Professor in Pharmacology. Elisa loves cats, running (slowly), good food, nice drinks, reading and most of all travelling to visit friends and places. Her astrological sign (and favourite monosaccharide) is a-L-fucose.'

During this time he undertook a professional training year in the lab of Professor Martin Caffrey at Trinity College Dublin, where he conducted structure-function studies of membrane proteins using X-ray crystallography. Following on from this, he obtained a PhD with a focus on computational chemistry and biophysics from the University of Dundee under the supervision of Professor Ulrich Zachariae, where he conducted novel research on the cation selectivity mechanisms of the TRP family of ion channels. In the eLab, his current research focuses on determining the structure of glycans, and understanding how glycosylation modulates the structure and function of membrane proteins and antibodies.

                In our research group we use high-performance computing (HPC) molecular simulation techniques to reconstruct complex carbohydrates (glycans) and to understand their many different roles in biology. During the past few years we have dedicated a huge amount of our time and computational resources to the creation of the GlycoShape DB, where we are continuously depositing equilibrium 3D structures of glycans, glycan fragments and epitopes, from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that can be used in combination with molecular docking and/or MD to study glycan recognition and with Re-Glyco to rebuild glycoproteins to their native functional state. In addition to the development of GlycoShape to advance research in structural glycobiology, we are actively working in the following research areas:

                    In the context of SARS-CoV-2's evolution and immune evasion, the glycosylation of the spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) is a focal point. The study delves into the specific role of N343 glycosylation across various variants, utilizing over 45 seconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results indicate the amphipathic N-glycan at N343 preserves the RBD's structural integrity, with its removal causing a uniform conformational change, affecting the receptor binding motif (RBM) in early strains (WHu-1, alpha, beta) but not in later ones (delta, omicron). Omicron variants, with key mutations near N343, maintain RBD architecture independent of the glycan, underscoring an evolutionary adaptation. Empirical data on RBD binding to monosialylated ganglioside co-receptors show dependency on N343 glycosylation for WHu-1 but not for delta, suggesting additional evolutionary changes in co-receptor interactions.</Text>

                    Molecular insights were acquired using all-atom force fields for protein, glycan, and solvent molecules, with analysis extending to variant under monitoring (VUM) omicron BA.2.86 ('pirola'). This variant has gained a new N-glycosylation site at N354, indicating the glycan shield's adaptive evolution.

Duration of the MD sampling is indicated on the top-right corner of each plot with the conformational equilibration time subtracted as the corresponding data were not included in the analysis. Representative structures from the MD trajectories of the WHu-1 RBD glycosylated (cyan) and non-glycosylated (blue) at N343 are shown on the right-hand side of the panel. The N343 glycan (GlyTouCan-ID G00998NI) is rendered with sticks in white, the hydrophobic residues underneath the N343 glycan are highlighted with VDW spheres, while the protein structure is represented with cartoons. Panel b) KDE plot of the backbone RMSD values (see details in panel a) above) calculated for the alpha (B.1.1.7) RBD glycosylated (left) and non-glycosylated (right) at N343. Representative structures from the MD simulation of the alpha RBDs are shown on the right-hand side of the panel, with the N343 glycosylated RBD shown with pink cartoons and the non-glycosylated alpha RBD in purple cartoons. Panel c) KDE plots of the backbone RMSD values calculated for the beta (B.1.351) RBD glycosylated (left) and non-glycosylated (right) at N343. Representative structures from the MD simulation of the beta RBDs are shown on the right-hand side of the panel, with the N343 glycosylated RBD shown with orange cartoons and the non-glycosylated alpha RBD in red cartoons. Panel d) Binding affinities (1/Kd, x103 M-1) for interactions between different RBDs (including intact and endoF3 treated WHu-1 RBD and alpha and beta RBD) and the GM1os (GlyTouCan-ID G46613JI) and GM2os (GlyTouCan-ID G61168WC) oligosaccharides.

Panel e) Predicted complex between the WHu-1 RBD and GM1os, with GM1os represented with sticks in SNFG colours, the protein represented with cartoons (cyan) and the N343 with sticks (white). Residues directly involved in the GM1os binding or proximal are labelled and highlighted with sticks. All N343 glycosylated RBDs carry also a FA2G2 N-glycan (GlyTouCan-ID G00998NI) at N331, which is not shown for clarity.

                    This paper's findings expand our understanding of glycosylation's critical roles in structure-function relationships of viral proteins. The potential for N343 to become a mutational hotspot and the structural dispensability of its glycosylation site may inform immune surveillance and vaccine design, considering the balance between protein fold integrity and immune recognition.
