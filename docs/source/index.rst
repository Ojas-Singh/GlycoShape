GlycoShape's documentation!
======================================

`GlycoShape <https://glycoshape.org>`_ is an OA database of glycans 3D structural data and information that can be downloaded or used with `Re-Glyco <https://glycoshape.org/reglyco>`_ to rebuild glycoproteins from the `RCSB PDB <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_ or `EMBL-EBI AlphaFold <https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/>`_ repositories.

This documentation is for expert users who want to install GlycoShape on their own servers or use the GlycoShape API to access the data programmatically.
