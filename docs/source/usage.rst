Using GlycoShape Website
========================

To use the GlycoShape website, follow these steps:

1. Access the website: `https://glycoshape.org`.

2. Searching for Glycans:
    - To search for a glycan by IUPAC, WURCS, GLYCAM ID, or GLYTOUCAN ID, use the search bar on the homepage.
    - To search for a glycan by drawing it, click on the "Draw" button and sketch the glycan structure.

3. Major Conformation Analysis:
    - For each glycan, the website provides information about its major conformation.
    - The major conformation is determined using MD sampling and Cluster Analysis with the GAP algorithm.

GlycoProtein Builder - Re-Glyco
===============================

The GlycoShape website also offers a GlycoProtein builder called "Re-Glyco". Follow these steps to use it:

1. Access the GlycoProtein builder: `https://glycoshape.org/reglyco`.

2. Fetching Protein Structure:
    - You can fetch a protein structure from Alphafold or the PDB bank by providing the corresponding PDB ID.
    - Alternatively, you can upload your own protein structure.

3. Glycosylation Sites Information:
    - The GlycoProtein builder retrieves glycosylation sites information from UniProt if available.
    - You can also use the GlcNAc scanner to identify potential glycosylable sites.

4. Building the Glycoprotein:
    - Once you have the protein structure and glycosylation information, you can build the full glycoprotein.
    - Choose the glycan of your choice to attach to the protein structure.

Note: For any further assistance or inquiries, please refer to the documentation or contact the GlycoShape team.
