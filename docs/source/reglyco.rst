Method 1: Calculate GlycoShape
------------------------------

To calculate the GlycoShape, we can use the following formula:

.. math::

    GlycoShape = \\frac{{2 \\pi \\times r}}{{h}}

where:
- :math:`r` is the radius of the glycan
- :math:`h` is the height of the glycan

Method 2: Plot GlycoShape
-------------------------

To plot the GlycoShape, we can use a Python library such as `matplotlib`. Here's an example code snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    def plot_glycoshape(radius, height):
         theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
         x = radius * np.cos(theta)
         y = radius * np.sin(theta)
         z = np.linspace(0, height, 100)

         fig = plt.figure()
         ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
         ax.plot_surface(x, y, z)

         ax.set_xlabel('X')
         ax.set_ylabel('Y')
         ax.set_zlabel('Z')

         plt.show()

    # Usage example
    plot_glycoshape(5, 10)

This code snippet will plot a 3D surface representing the GlycoShape based on the given radius and height.

Note: Make sure to install the required libraries before running the code.

Method 3: Analyze GlycoShape
----------------------------

To analyze the GlycoShape, we can perform various calculations such as calculating the surface area, volume, or moments of inertia. These calculations depend on the specific requirements of your analysis.
