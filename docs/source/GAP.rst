Glycan Analysis Pipeline
========================

Introduction
------------
The Glycan Analysis Pipeline (GAP) is a pakaage for the analysis of Glycan structures. It is a python package that provides a novel algorithm for the conformational analysis of the glycan structures from Molecular dynamics simulations.

Math Equations
--------------

Here are some math equations used in GAP:

1. Equation 1: :math:`f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1`

2. Equation 2: :math:`g(x) = \frac{{1}}{{x}}`

Code Snippets
-------------

Here is an example code snippet in GAP:

.. code-block:: none

   def calculate_fitness(individual):
       # Calculate the fitness of an individual
       fitness = ...
       return fitness

   def crossover(parent1, parent2):
       # Perform crossover between two parents
       child = ...
       return child

   def mutate(individual):
       # Perform mutation on an individual
       mutated_individual = ...
       return mutated_individual
